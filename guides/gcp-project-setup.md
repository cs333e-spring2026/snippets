Follow these steps to set up your GCP project for *Elements of Data Integration*. Each person should create their own project for this course. 
### Create a GCP project

1. Go to [https://console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com) and log in using your gmail account (not your utexas account). If you do not have a gmail account, please create one now before proceeding.

2. Once logged in, if you have never used Google Cloud before, you will see the following: Click on **Try for Free**. GCP gives you $300 initially as a free trial, which is for your personal use. If you have used GCP before, you won't see this free trial option and you can skip to step 4.

3. You can sign up for the free trial if you'd like, but you'll need to provide a credit card number to do that. Note that you will only be charged if you exceed the $300 credit. We will be creating a billing alert to avoid this issue.

4. Create a GCP project by clicking on the drop-down at the top of the page and selecting new project. If you signed up for the free trial, a GCP project should have been created for you by the name of **My First Project**. 

5. Change the name of your project to match your EID. To rename the GCP project, click on the three dots on the top right on the navigation bar and click on **Project Settings** in the dropdown.

6. Under **Settings**, you will be able to rename the project. 

### Grant permissions on your project

7. Click on the navigation menu on the top-left corner, select **IAM & admin**, and navigate to the **IAM** menu.

8. Click on **Grant access** to add the instructor's emails as editors on your GCP Project. This will give the Professor and TAs access to your GCP Project so that they can grade your assignments and help you during office hours.

9. In the **New Members** input box, enter cs333e.instructors@gmail.com. Under **Role**, select **Owner** and assign the **Owner** role to this email account.

10. Grant Project Owner access to your project partner by following the previous two steps with your partner's email. 

### Requesting a GCP coupon

11. Retrieve your GCP coupon from [here](https://vector.my.salesforce-sites.com/GCPEDU?cid=KNZULOjOUjbFipJyI4gX79YxtkUD61D%2BZwKrsAxrdZot8sHQ3zFSPYT9oiYj448P/). 
12. After submitting the form, you should receive an email shortly, asking you to verify your email; upon verification, you will receive your coupon code by email.

### Activating your coupon

13. Before moving forward, please ensure that you are logged in with your gmail account and not your utexas.edu account.

**Very Important: The utexas.edu account should ONLY be used for retrieving your coupon code. The activation of the coupon must be done with your gmail account. If you have any questions about this, please stop here and post your question on Ed or come to office hours.**

14. Once you receive your coupon code, log out of your utexas account and log in with your gmail account before activating your coupon. Go to [https://console.cloud.google.com/education](https://console.cloud.google.com/education) to activate your coupon.

15. Enter your coupon code into the form and click Accept and Continue. This will activate the coupon and an Education billing account will be created.

### Linking your GCP Project to your billing account

18. Locate your GCP Project and click on the three dots next to it.
